# FoodTruckProject

# Description:
In this project we had to get input from the user to determine how many food trucks there were, what their names were, what type of food they had and their rating.

Once we received the users information we had to store it and create a menu that would allow the user to display all the food trucks, get the average rating for all the food trucks, show the highest rated food truck, and allow the user to quit the app.

# Technologies Used
Throughout this lab I used many different method to finish everything. I used many methods, arrays, instantiation, getters, setters, toString, constructors, switches, if statements, for loops, while loops, do loops, basically you name it I did it!


# What I learned
I had difficulty instantiating my array. This was definitely the biggest problem I had to overcome! Originally I didn't want to give the array a set length so I could change it later but that is not allowed! So I had to pivot and give the array a length of 5 then have all my code ignore any null values it received. Aside from that this lab went surprisingly smoothly. I think I understand the point of a constructor and my setters and getters a bit better although definitely still need to work on my understanding of it all.
